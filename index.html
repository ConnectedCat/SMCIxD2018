                      <p class="card-text"><small>As a reaction to the ubiquity of uninspired, static hand gestures, Heidi Gaudet created (Unusual) Moldable Interactions. Her material research led her to play and think about how interfaces could be reimagined as expressive, moldable surfaces. Her early experiments included the study of sensory experiences aroused by Jell-O, agar, and slime. When paired with a visual and/or physical output (triggered by a pressure sensor embedded in slime), these malleable substances produce a feeling of deep satisfaction and agency. The experimental nature gives the sense of being able to manipulate a previously inaccessible surface/dimension</small></p>
                      <p class="card-text"><small>Alongside Artificial Knowing, Heidi participated in performative prototyping, from which the idea of expressive interactions was born. Next came the creation of two additional controls: the flex sensor and arm movement.</small></p>
                      <p class="card-text"><small>From the hardware to the interface, Heidi sought to create an experience which felt at once familiar yet surprising and could ground the tactile controllers. Her intent with these objects is to find the meeting point between experimentation and innovation. After graduation she will continue to apply this process to the exploration of new interface models.</small></p>

                      <p class="card-text"><small>My mom is not alone. 30% of the 15 million heart attack survivors in the US have the same concern as my mom, and now suffer from anxiety or depression. Panic leads to feelings of a heart attack, which leads to more anxiety, which makes their panic attacks worse. Another survivor I interviewed said it makes him feel better to see what his heart is doing. This led me to the concept of a wearable heart rate and EKG monitor which connects the wearer to their heart's activity and their loved ones to them in the case of an emergency through a mobile app, which communicates with the wearable. This became ALEYE.</small></p>

Today, with technologies like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, voice interactions support thousands of people in their day-to-day. You can ask Alexa to dim the lights while you browse through Netflix, and Siri can update you on your morning commute while you pour yourself a cup of coffee. But what if you weren’t physically able to use a remote control, or get a brew going for that matter? Current voice technologies lack standalone data connectivity, smart remote control, and intelligent adaptation to speech impairment. Charlie, on the other hand, is a cloud based personalized assistant that syncs to all your devices and adjusts itself depending on who you are and what you need.</small></p>

                      <p class="card-text"><small>With that in mind, I conducted intense research to develop a project that would allow people to be honestly informed, in real time, by news sources rigorously vetted. Insta-Fact, a system that recognizes and analyzes news sources and lets people know if what they are listening to or watching is truthful or not by scouring all available sources on the internet to determine the validity of the source. Since there is no such thing as completely true or false, the system uses color codes along with a percentage scale to let people know the relative validity of the source: Red = 00% - 49% truth = FAKE | Yellow = 50% - 89% truth = BIASED | Green = 90% - 100% truth = FACT.</small></p>
